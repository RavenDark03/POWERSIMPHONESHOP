Santua, Matthew Marc C. Information Management
ITE 241
Gadget Depot (Pawnshop) Management System
A. Company Background
Business Name: Gadget Depot (Pawnshop)
Location: Bagong Nayon, City of Baliuag, Bulacan (Beside Puregold Baliuag)
Service Type: Specialized Pawnshop (Consumer Electronics and Silver Jewelry)
Operational Context:
Gadget Depot has been serving the Baliuag community since 2007, marking
over 18 years of operation. Unlike generalist pawnshops, the business employs a
niche strategy, accepting only consumer electronics (gadgets) and silver jewelry
as collateral. The workforce consists of a lean team of three to five personnel,
comprising a Manager, Administrative Staff, and a dedicated Appraiser.
Problem Statement:
Gadget Depot has been around for a long time, but its manual operation is
disjointed. Although it is used for some purposes, a stand-alone Point of Sale
(POS) system is not connected to the main record-keeping procedure. Microsoft
Excel spreadsheets that were manually encoded from handwritten paper logs
make up the main database. This redundancy leads to significant risks, including:
1. Data Inconsistency: Discrepancies between handwritten logs and Excel
records.
2. Lack of Visibility: Management cannot generate real-time total income
reports; staff act primarily as encoders rather than analysts.
3. Process Inefficiency: Manual calculation of penalties and interest is timeconsuming and prone to human error.
4. Auction Management Risks: Tracking expiring loans ("Subasta") relies on
manual monitoring, leading to potential customer disputes regarding
foreclosed items.

Name of Interviewee: Ma’am Joyce
Name of Interviewer: Matthew Marc Santua
Date of Interview: 11/26/2025
[Begin Transcript 00:00:03]
Interviewer: When did your business start/operate?
Ma’am Joyce: It started around 2007, so it has been about 17-18 years now.
[00:00:28]
Interviewer: Who are the target customers of your business?
Ma’am Joyce: Everyone is welcome.
[00:00:42]
Interviewer: How many staff members does Gadget Depot currently have? What
are their roles?
Ma’am Joyce: It depends, but mostly 5 or 3. Sometimes, if no one else is available,
it’s just two of us really—the Staff and the Appraiser.
Interviewer: Is the manager present right now?
Ma’am Joyce: No, they are not here.
[00:01:12]
Interviewer: Regarding your business processes, how do you contact or reach the
customer?
Ma’am Joyce: Through text message or call using the contact number they
provided.
[00:01:40]
Interviewer: So, Ma’am, do you accept online bookings, or is it strictly walk-in?
Ma’am Joyce: Mostly, it is really just walk-ins.
Interviewer: Let’s say a customer books an inquiry, how do you record it? Is it
through a system or written down?
Ma’am Joyce: Both. Written and in the system.
[00:02:26]
Interviewer: About your service delivery, can you describe the step-by-step
process? Like when a customer enters...
Ma’am Joyce: It goes like this: when a customer enters, they present the item
they want to pawn. We check the item. We don’t accept every item offered for
pawning; we have a basis for whether we accept it or not.
[00:02:59]
Interviewer: Who services or speaks to the customer regarding the item?
Ma’am Joyce: Only the Appraiser.
[00:03:20]
Interviewer: What software do you use?
Ma’am Joyce: Usually, it’s really just Microsoft Excel.
[00:03:40]
Interviewer: How often do you update the records in your system?
Ma’am Joyce: Everyday.
[00:03:51]
Interviewer: In case I want to redeem an item? What payment methods are
available?
Ma’am Joyce: It can be done online, like GCash or bank transfer.
[00:04:10]
Interviewer: How do you compute the billing or service cost for a pawned item?
Ma’am Joyce: If it passes the due date, there is a penalty. If it’s not past due, it’s
just the principal amount plus the interest.
[00:04:30]
Interviewer: Do you issue Official Receipts?
Ma’am Joyce: Yes.
[00:04:41]
Interviewer: Do you also have after-sales support? Let’s say, do you follow up
with the customer because their due date is approaching?
Ma’am Joyce: We text or call them when the due date is near or has actually
arrived.
[00:04:56]
Interviewer: How do you handle complaints? Do you receive any?
Ma’am Joyce: It can’t be avoided sometimes. When we explain the terms and
conditions, they just say "Yes, Yes," but when their due date arrives, they act as if
it’s our fault.
[00:05:22]
Interviewer: What is the most important information you usually need from the
pawner?
Ma’am Joyce: The most important details are the name, address, the contact
number they provided so we can reach them, and their ID.
[00:05:45]
Interviewer: In the system you currently use, what information is the hardest to
track?
Ma’am Joyce: None really, because when we input into the system, it immediately
generates its own ID number.
[00:06:12]
Interviewer: In your system, do you have features for generating total income or
viewing the business's total earnings?
Ma’am Joyce: We don’t see that because we focus more on encoding. We don’t
really see the total earnings.
[00:06:33]
Interviewer: What common problems do you usually encounter in the business?
Ma’am Joyce: When an item/unit is foreclosed (auctioned), the customer can no
longer reclaim it—things like that. Or when they pass the due date, the penalties
pile up. Those are the usual problems.
[00:07:07]
Interviewer: Of the problems you mentioned, which task takes the most time or
effort?
Ma’am Joyce: It’s when an item is about to be foreclosed; we have to update
them. It’s up to them if they will redeem it or follow the agreed-upon date.
[00:07:30]
Interviewer: If I were to provide system features for you, what would you wish to
improve or automate in your system?
Ma’am Joyce: Nothing specific, as long as we can encode. For example, ensuring
penalties and due dates are all there.
[00:07:56]
Interviewer: Have you encountered counterfeit items or fakes?
Ma’am Joyce: Yes, we have. Also, some units are still under installment plans
[from other carriers/stores].
[00:08:17]
Interviewer: Are your receipts generated through the system or handwritten?
Ma’am Joyce: Oh no, they are strictly handwritten.
[00:08:34]
Interviewer: Can I suggest a system feature? I suggest that when you contact the
customer, it should be direct from the system.
Ma’am Joyce: Some respond better that way, but it’s faster through text
message or call, or sometimes online like Facebook Messenger.
[00:09:10]
Interviewer: Your system is really just Microsoft Excel?
Ma’am Joyce: We do actually have our own POS.
[00:09:36]
Interviewer: For the information you input, do you rely on the System or Manual
recording?
Ma’am Joyce: It can be both. Manual first, then we check it against the system.
[00:11:10]
Interviewer: Again, what devices do you use? Do you have a Computer and POS
Machine, or is the POS on the computer? And a cellphone for contacting
customers?
Ma’am Joyce: Yes, the POS is on the computer, and as mentioned, the phone is
for contact.
C. App Objective
1. Main Goal
To develop a Centralized Pawnshop Management Information System
(CPMIS) that integrates customer data management, appraisal, loan processing,
and inventory tracking into a single digital platform. This system will replace the
hybrid paper-Excel workflow to ensure data integrity, automate financial
calculations, and secure the auction management process.
2. Specific Objectives
● Automate Financial Calculations: Implement an algorithm that automatically
calculates interest and penalties based on the loan duration to eliminate
manual computation errors and revenue leakage (addressing the "penalties
pile up" issue).
● Streamline Foreclosure Management: Create an automated "Expiry Alert
System" that flags loans entering the grace period and generates lists of items
eligible for auction ("Subasta") to streamline the update process mentioned
by Ma’am Joyce.
● Centralize Record Keeping: Consolidate the "Manual Log," "Excel Sheet,"
and "POS" data into one relational database to allow management to view
real-time reports on Total Income and Active Loans.
● Enhance Inventory Security: Implement a validation check for serial
numbers/IMEIs during appraisal to flag items that are potentially blacklisted or
currently under installment plans with other entities.
3. Scope and Limitations
● Scope: The system will cover Customer Registration (KYC), Item Appraisal
(Gadget/Silver specific attributes), Loan Issuance (Printing Pawn Tickets),
Payment Processing (Renewal/Redemption), and Auction Tagging.
● Limitations:
○ The system will not include an online customer portal for remote
payments; it will record payments made via GCash/Bank Transfer but will
not process the transaction itself (no payment gateway integration).
○ It applies only to Gadgets and Silver Jewelry (no gold/diamond appraisal
matrix).
○ SMS notifications will be triggered by the system but sent via a connected
mobile device or gateway, as the staff prefers faster text/call methods.

E. Module / Process Description
Data Flow Diagram (DFD) - Level 1
Module / Process Description
Module 1.0: Manage Customer & Intake (KYC)
Description: Handles the registration and verification of borrowers. It ensures no
duplicate records exist and verifies the customer is of legal age.
• Inputs:
o Customer ID Card (Passport, Driver’s License, etc.).
o Personal Information (Name, Address, DOB, Phone).
• Data Stores Accessed: D1: CUSTOMER
• Process Logic:
1. Search: Query D1 using First_Name + Last_Name or ID_Number.
2. Decision:
▪ If Found: Return existing customer_id.
▪ If Not Found:
▪ Check DOB: Is (Current Date - DOB) >= 18 years?
▪ If Yes: Insert new record into D1. Generate new
customer_id.
▪ If No: Display error "Customer is a minor."
• Outputs: Verified customer_id.
Module 2.0: Appraise & Grant Loan
Description: The core transaction. It records the item, calculates deductions, and
issues the pawn ticket.
• Inputs:
o customer_id (From Module 1.0).
o Item Details (Category, Description, Serial).
o Appraised Value (Principal Amount).
o employee_id (Current logged-in user).
• Data Stores Accessed: D2: LOAN, D3: ITEM
• Process Logic:
1. Calculate Deductions:
▪ Interest = Principal × Interest Rate (e.g., 0.04).
▪ Service Charge = Fixed Amount (e.g., 5.00) or Percentage.
▪ Net Proceeds = Principal - (Interest + Service Charge).
2. Set Dates:
▪ Date_Granted = Today.
▪ Maturity_Date = Today + 30 Days.
▪ Expiry_Date = Maturity_Date + 90 Days (Grace Period).
3. Commit to Database:
▪ Insert Item details into D3.
▪ Insert Loan details into D2 with Status = 'Active'.
4. Print: Generate Physical Pawn Ticket.
• Outputs: Pawn Ticket, Cash Release (Net Proceeds).
Module 3.0: Process Payment
Description: Handles money coming in. The system must decide if the payment is
for Interest (Renewal) or Principal (Redemption).
• Inputs:
o Pawn Ticket Number (loan_id).
o Cash Tendered.
o Transaction Type (Renewal / Redemption).
• Data Stores Accessed: D2: LOAN, D4: PAYMENT
• Process Logic:
1. Retrieve Loan: Query D2 by loan_id. Check Status.
2. Calculate Penalty:
▪ If Current_Date > Maturity_Date:
▪ Penalty = Principal × Penalty_Rate × (Days_Late / 30).
▪ Else: Penalty = 0.
3. Process Transaction:
▪ If Renewal:
▪ Required Amount = Interest + Penalty.
▪ Update D2: Set Maturity_Date = Maturity_Date + 30
Days.
▪ If Redemption:
▪ Required Amount = Principal + Interest + Penalty.
▪ Update D2: Set Status = 'Redeemed'.
4. Record Payment: Insert into D4 with employee_id.
• Outputs: Official Receipt (OR), Change Amount, (Item returned if
Redeemed).
Module 4.0: Monitor & Auction (End of Lifecycle)
Description: An automated or manager-triggered process to handle loans that
were not paid.
• Inputs:
o System Date (Trigger).
o Auction Sale Details (Buyer, Price).
• Data Stores Accessed: D2: LOAN, D3: ITEM, D5: AUCTION_SALE
• Process Logic:
1. Sub-Process 4.1: Flag Overdue (Automated)
▪ Scan D2 where Status = 'Active'.
▪ If Current_Date > Expiry_Date:
▪ Update D2: Set Status = 'For Auction'.
▪ Trigger SMS Reminder (Optional).
2. Sub-Process 4.2: Record Auction Sale (Manual)
▪ User selects Item from "Auction List".
▪ Input Sold_Price and Buyer_Name.
▪ Insert record into D5.
▪ Update D2: Set Status = 'Sold'.
▪ Update D3: Set Storage_Loc = 'Sold Out'.
• Outputs: Overdue List Report, Auction Performance Report.
